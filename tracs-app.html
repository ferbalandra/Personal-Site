    <p>Lead UX/UI Designer. In charge of designing user experience and UI elements
      
    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu silver sans-serif fw2">Overview</p>

    <p>
     TRACS is Texas State University's current Learning Management system for the student body. The TRACS app is the an app designed to fit the students needs on a device, while maintaining full system functionality.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The project was initiated based on user feedback from students, that had a need to see or do specific functions within the LMS on their devices. The new design lets students quickly learned their grades, which is one of the elements they wanted to be able to access.
    </p>
    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu silver sans-serif fw2">My process</p>
    <a href="images/studio_flowchart.jpegdownload" download="flowchart"><img src="images/studio_flowchart.jpeg" alt="studio fuction flowchart"></a>
    <p>
     Based on the user testing feedback we got from asking users about the current LMS, we gather  that students had a need to access their current project grades more efficiently; as well as accessing certain other resources offered on the LMS. The teamed gathered feedback and combined with data we picked the top most used tools on the LMS and designed an app geared towards those tools, while still mainting full system fuctionality.
    </p>
    <p>The initial stages of design where a paper wireframe where I showed the team and users how the app can function and the flow of the screens.</p>
    <img src="images/wireframe-youstar.png" alt="wireframe example">
    <p>from the pencil sketches the developer starting forming initial placeholder spaces in the app where functonality can be shown speeding the process for developemnt and design. This style of collaboration is the best for faster delivering of a product, since de developer does not have to wait for final design to deliver fuctionality, and designer can quickly switch ideas if they encounter any system restrictions.</p>
    <p>For this project assets where delivered from a Sketch file senging a cloud link for visual reference and communicating with the developer for desired interactions and visual details. In my experinece the manner of delivering assets varies as to how the team would like to collaborate and the different skills of a developer. This project was done on React platform so the developer felt more comfortable at making elements and then collaborating to adjust to match design.</p>
    <p>Images here of examples</p>
    <p>From a simple design we gathered some user feedback utilizing a class, collaborating with a professor where we where able to see how students will interact wiht the app, running thorugh a list of tasks and seeing if there where any issues.</p>
    <p>From the intitial user feedback we made changes and adjusted some of the interactions that where difficult for users, and added some fucntionality that students found missing.</p>
    <p>Before deploying the app a final pass at user tested was conducted with a different set of users. A second round of testing is always helpful for final touches and gathering more feedback.</p>
