        <li>Why Design Systems fail</li>
        <li> Execution details</li>
        <li>Steps for getting started</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >So, What is a Design System?</p>
      <p>Style guide or visual pattern library, Design tooling, Component library, Code usage guidelines and documentation, Design usage documentation, Animation language, Voice and tone guidelines</p>
      <p>Style guide or visual pattern library a visual group of all the components that encompass a brand. Design tooling is a component broken down in one place and you can see all of them as standalone items. </p>
      <p>Component library is the code and interactions attached to each element, how to use them and where. Code usage guidelines and documentation is a guide on how to write the code the usage of the elements where the design team can indicate the purpose of an item and make decisions of usage gidelines. <a href="http://carbondesignsystem.com">Carbon IBM </a>has a really good example of this design usage documentation. </p>
      <p>Animation language is a standarization of some interactions that can be drawing from actual items that the brand makes or uses like IBM uses examples to use as animations</p>
      <p>Voice and tone guide, MailChimp has a good voice style guide voice is what you are saying but the tone is how you say it. <a href="http://voiceandtone.com">See their voice and tone Guide</a> Voice can also be added to error messages </p>

      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Reasons why Design systems fail</p>
      <p>Define what to means of a design system to fail: Nobody Uses it. If noone uses it then the benefit of it get lost.The goal is to create Happy Design Systems. </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Scale Good Standards</li>
        <li>Build-in Accessibility</li>
        <li>Unify Component Style</li>
        <li>Unify Component Code</li>
        <li>Reduce Code Cruft</li>
        <li>Speed Up Product Delivery</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >How to build systmes that work</p>
      <p><span class="purple b">Investment</span> To have a successful design system, you need to make a continuous effort to invest resources into it. A successful design system is like a successful exercise program. It needs to be consistent and continuisly working on it and kept up to date that adapts to changes and new needs. Designs systems becasuse they scale they can get really large.</p>
      <p><span class="purple b">Comunication</span> should include as many people as possible, communication is multidirectional. It is important to ask users what they want, listen to them and make user feel like part of the process  </p>
      <p><span class="purple b">Buy-in</span> Showing is more powerful than telling. Creating a small example to show is a great way to find bugs, incorporate feedback and get buy in. A hackathon is a great way to show examples that are quick.</p>
      <p><span class="purple b">Solid Architecture</span>Build a system that can grow and remove parts, systems do better when they can change and evolve easier. A good example is where there is a system that builds from a core and adds different modules to it. Core like variables, colors, sizing, fonts etc and they build up modular. Another important aspect is to creatre a semantic Versioning where they are Major. Minor. or Patch versions. Having a system to name things is very useful and keep them standirized between design, naming values on code and verions togehter.  </p>
      <p>Namespace since the begining where you tie classes and components, where you also create a system of naming elements and everyone uses the same</p>

      <p class="silver b mb-neg" > So You Want to Build a Design System?</p>
      <p>Goal/hypothesis setting why you want to do it what probelm you are trying to solve with a design system?, then do a Review What You’ve Got do a code and site audit based on what your goal. </p>
