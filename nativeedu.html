    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Project Overview</p>
    <p>As part of my design journey at USAA, I identified education gaps in understanding native design principles among the design team. To address this, I proposed and initiated a native education program for USAA designers. The objective of the program was to elevate the skills of designers, ensuring that every line of business had designers who are confident in designing across multiple platforms.</p>
   
    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Role</p>
    <p>I led this initiative by starting with a baseline survey to measure success criteria and evaluate the collective understanding of native design within USAA. After analyzing the data, I developed a curriculum divided into basic and advanced modules to address the organization's educational gaps.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Challenges</p>
    <p>One of the main challenges was to establish a comprehensive program from scratch while balancing ongoing project work. Additionally, there was some resistance from designers concerned about the time commitment required for the program.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Process</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Baseline Survey</strong>: Created and distributed a baseline survey to measure the collective understanding of native design principles.</li>
      <li><strong>Curriculum Development</strong>: Developed a curriculum divided into basic and advanced modules based on survey findings and educational needs.</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration</strong>: Recruited a team of designers to collaborate on content creation and organized the program's modules, setting goals to deliver three basic modules in the first year.</li>
      <li><strong>Content Creation</strong>: Outlined content for each module, assigned topics, and created material using resources like HIG and Material Design guidelines.</li>
      <li><strong>Publishing and Feedback</strong>: Published modules and collected feedback to improve future content, ensuring the program meets its educational goals.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Key Decisions</p>
    <p>My initiative led to the development of a new education program that enhanced designers' confidence and technical skills in native design, fostering a culture of continuous learning and improvement within the organization.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Outcomes and Impact</p>
    <p>By the end of the year, the program will have delivered six modules, significantly improving the baseline understanding of native design within the organization. A follow-up survey will measure the program's impact on designers' skills and confidence levels.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Learnings</p>
    <p>Leading this initiative taught me the importance of structured learning and collaboration. It reinforced the value of a targeted approach to education, using data to drive decisions and adapt to feedback.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Conclusion</p>
    <p>This case study demonstrates my ability to lead and implement strategic educational initiatives that drive skill development and promote a culture of continuous improvement within the organization.</p>
