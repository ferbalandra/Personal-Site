          When the American people go online to access government
          services, they’re often met with confusing navigation
          systems, an array of visual brands, and inconsistent
          interaction patterns.
          Creating consistency between these systems will help
          people more efectively access the services they need an
          increase their trust in the government.

      <p> When design is consistent it gives the user more of a safe feeling chesive, unified</p>

      <h3 class="ttu f4 b mt4">Design System</h3>
    
    
    <p>A system is an interconnected set of elements coherently organized in a
way that achieves something. Systems can fail if they dont have a standard purpose and if they are difficult to implement. </p>
    <p>Start your design system with user-scenarios.</p>

    <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Why</p>
    <p>Easier to design, build, launch, maintain, and evolve the sites on platforms. Tell better stories faster</p>
    <p>Needed to support different designs but unify into one code system, but allow brands to feel distinct </p>
    <p>ADD images here of problems </p>
    
    <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Flexible components Issues </p>
    <p> When using modular systems for several sites they look consistent but they loose personality and we do not take the user into account.</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Sites felt too similar</li>
      <li>  Did not reflect critical
        diferences in content,
        tone, and audience</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Modules didn’t have a clear purpose. And sites may loose personality </p>
    <p>Successful design systems start with content and people. </p>

  <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Implement it better </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Start with fast, unified platform</li>
    <li>Be scenario-driven when creating
    variations</li>
    <li>Find key moments for visual brand
    expression that serve our audience</li>
  </ol>

  <p> Do a UI inventory of the design system or elements used. Group items into purpose and mapped them in a user story. Why or how user use these UI elements and how </p>
  <p>Keeping this map in my mind helped me think in families of patterns joined by a shared purpose, rather than individual pages.</p>
  <p>By doing this we can identify elements and design better components that have the information and fucntion that is actually needed</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Identify core workflows and the patterns
    that need to support these workflows.</li>
    <li>Understand the role each pattern plays in
    a user’s journey.</li>
    <li>Define how the patterns work together
    to create a cohesive experience</li>
  </ul>
<p class="ttu"> so How we Turn 18 distinct templates with 81 code snippets into 1 flexible design system</p>
<p class="b">Identifying Core Workflows</p><p>Audience goals consistent
across brands, but content difered.  Only add a layout if there’s
a content need.</p>
<p> Content Audit is necessary to look at the elements which can be included in the new system. Does this component add value ? Is it available to more than 3 brands ? is it esential ?</p>
<p> Name components collaboratively, The purpose of each component into the system if you collaborate with names it becomes easier to keep it consistent</p>

<p> Flexibility levers Brad Frost talks about elements that can be different but still keeps the look consistent <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/pattern-variations/">Pattern Variations</a></p>
<p> Some of the components can be more of a free form and some are just designed for a time frame that can be reporpused later or is just part of a campaign </p>
