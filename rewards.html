    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Project Overview</p>
    <p>The primary goal of this project was to design a loyalty rewards program for USAA members that would deepen their relationship with the organization and express loyalty and gratitude for their membership. This program aimed to provide a meaningful value exchange, enhancing members' engagement and connection with USAA through personalized rewards.</p>
   
    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Role</p>

    <p>
     As the lead designer, I took charge of translating the strategic objectives of our business partners into a compelling user experience on a native app. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to understand their goals and logistical constraints, ultimately creating a visual representation that would convey the essence of the loyalty program to our members.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Challenges</p>
       <p>
      The most significant challenge was working as the sole designer on the project. This required balancing the diverse needs of the business with the genuine problems and desires of our members. Navigating this complexity involved ensuring that the program was both strategically aligned with USAA's goals and genuinely beneficial to our members. </p>

      <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Process</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Market Research</strong>: I began by immersing myself in comprehensive market research to understand current loyalty program trends, member expectations, and potential opportunities for differentiation.</li>
        <li><strong>Understanding Business Goals</strong>: I collaborated with business partners to align on goals and requirements, ensuring that the program would not only meet member needs but also drive business outcomes.</li>
        <li><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong>: I conducted a competitive analysis to identify gaps in existing loyalty programs and discover unique ways USAA could differentiate itself in the market.</li>
        <li><strong>Concept Development</strong>: I sketched out several concepts for the program, incorporating insights from my research. Each concept was designed to address different facets of member engagement and business objectives.</li>
        <li><strong>Research and Refinement</strong>: Through small-scale quantitative research, I tested these concepts with a sample of members to gauge their effectiveness and appeal. Based on the feedback, I refined the designs to balance business and member priorities.</li>
    </ol>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Key Decisions</p>

    <p>
     My designs played a pivotal role in securing top-of-house funding for a multi-year program that is set to generate significant revenue for the organization. The visual and strategic representation of the program helped stakeholders understand its potential impact and align on a shared vision for its future.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Outcomes and Impact</p>

        <p>
    The project led to the creation of a brand-new loyalty rewards program, a first for USAA. This initiative is expected to foster deeper member engagement, build long-term loyalty, and drive substantial financial growth for the organization. The program is now a key component of USAA's member retention and satisfaction strategy.</p>
      
      

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Learnings</p>
     <p>Leading this project taught me the importance of balancing business objectives with genuine user needs. Working as a solo designer on a high-impact project also reinforced the value of collaboration and clear communication with stakeholders to align on shared goals. </p>

     <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Conclusion</p>
     <p>This case study showcases my ability to lead complex design projects, navigate challenges, and deliver solutions that create meaningful value for both the business and its customers. </p>


      <p>The strategy also included rules and standardization so when a team needs to make an update there is a single unified message and it is consistent with the branding.</p>
