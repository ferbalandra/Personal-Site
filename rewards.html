    <p>Loyalty Rewards Program — Redesigning Member Engagement UX Strategy & End-to-End Product Design for Financial ServicesA strategic loyalty program for USAA members designed to • deepen long-term engagement • deliver personalized value • and drive measurable member satisfaction and retention.</p>
   
    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Role</p>

    <p>
     As the lead designer, I took charge of translating the strategic objectives of our business partners into a compelling user experience on a native app. I collaborated closely with stakeholders to understand their goals and logistical constraints, ultimately creating a visual representation that would convey the essence of the loyalty program to our members.</p>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Problem to solve</p>
       <p>
      TUSAA wanted to introduce its first comprehensive loyalty rewards program to better express gratitude to members and strengthen relational value beyond banking products. The challenge was twofold: </p>
  <ul>
  <li>Create a member experience that feels genuinely rewarding and personalized</li>
  <liLAlign business goals with UX strategy in a traditionally risk-averse financial ecosystem</li> </ul>

<p>This required balancing emotionally compelling UX with quantifiable business outcomes.</p>

      <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">My approach</p>
        <ol>
        <li><strong>Market & Competitive Analysis</strong>: I audited leading loyalty programs across financial and non-financial sectors to identify proven engagement strategies and opportunities to differentiate. Key insights drove prioritization of reward categories and potential personalization tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Alignment Workshops</strong>: I collaborated with business partners to align on goals and requirements, ensuring that the program would not only meet member needs but also drive business outcomes.</li>
        
    <img src="images/Step1-loyalty.png" alt="cocnept, audience" class="w-80 db center pb3">
  <li><strong>Research & Concept Testing</strong>: Rather than assume member preferences, I conducted quantitative member testing on early concept sketches to validate appeal and uncover unmet needs — giving us data that informed next iterations.</li>
        <li><strong>Concept Development</strong>: I sketched out several concepts for the program, incorporating insights from my research. Each concept was designed to address different facets of member engagement and business objectives.</li>

    </ol>

    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Impact and Results </p>

    <p>Secured Executive Funding: My design artifacts and concept narrative directly contributed to gaining multi-year funding from senior leadership.</p>

  <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Expected Outcomes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Program launch as USAA’s first loyalty rewards initiative</li>
    <li>Designed to drive deeper engagement with member services</li>
    <li>Expected to increase retention and satisfaction metrics</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="f6 mb0 ttu purple sans-serif b">Key Learnings (Senior Reflection)</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Balancing strategic goals with user motivation is a core UX leadership skill—especially in regulated spaces like
      financial services.
    </li>
    <li>
      Solo leadership strengthened prioritization and communication skills by driving cross-functional alignment without
      a dedicated design team.
    </li>
    <li>
      Clear documentation of decisions and the “why” behind them increases stakeholder trust.
    </li>
  </ul>
