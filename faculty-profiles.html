    <p class="f6 mb0 ttu silver sans-serif fw2">Overview</p>

    <p>
      Faculty Profiles is a public site where users can search and find professors profiles. Each professor in Texas State University has a system where they enter their Curriculum Vitae and this site shows that information in a interface that is user friendly. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Users can search for a professor by name, keyword or by their associated college or department; covering a wider range on how users would search for information or a person. Searching a keyword the user can see how many faculty have work, awards or any grant on that topic, exposing their talents to anyone who wishes to learn about Texas State faculty. 
    </p>

    <p>
     For this project we were only given the desired results, to be able to find a faculty and show their profile, it was imperative to create a process that would account for the different approaches users would take in order to find a person.
   </p>
    <p>I gathered requirements and features needed to create content for the site and mapped out possible user journeys utilizing personas from students, staff, or any outside person interested in accessing our profiles. By creating user journeys before creating any wireframe we were able to determine what filtering system we wanted on the front page and how information should be hierarchy shown on the profil </p>

    <p>After implementing some light design mocks where presented to the project board and along with user testing we were able to delete and add some content that users where more interested in seeing inside a faculty's profile.</p>
    <p><span class="b">Collaboration with devs.</span> For initial delivery of elements I started creating a small html css page and hosted it on my Github site to show a high-res prototype, and sharing sketch files were able to quickly add the elements on a site that we showed to users and finalized design </p>
