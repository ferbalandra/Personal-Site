      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Planning ahead</p>
      <p>We review wireframes because of their predictive and preventive value.Storyboards help surface disagreement earlier in the process. Starting the process with wireframes and as much information on them helps start converstion since the begining</p>
      <p>Accessibility is an outcome. Inclusive Design is a process. learn from accidental accessibility and how can we purposly include it in our design </p>
      <p>Inclusive UX Design. The intentional facilitation and crafting of the interactions within an ecosystem that incorporates inclusion as a core value. When we include in in our core value is gets implemented because is part of the process.</p>
      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Techniques</p>
        <p class="b">Communication</p>
        <p>Add as more annotations to wireframes and communciate as much context as possible so the design is intentional and the developers or the next teammante doesnt have to guess later what the intent was.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="b">Reverse engineering</p>
        <p>You can prevent before things happen when designing in code. Reverse engineering by bringing it back to wireframe state where you can catch some things that may not be ovbvios at product stage</p>
        <p class="b">Interaction tables</p>
        <p class="b">Practice Inclusive Design</p>
        <p>Inclusion encompass more than accessibliity is including every user The practice of inclusive design puts you ahead of the curve for best practices for accessibility that will become a future standard X months from now.</p>
        <p>Usability studies help you learn things that can become patterns that can be included as core values and be included as standards. Design with people with disabilities, not FOR people with disabilities. You can do this by usability testing</p>
      <p class="b" >Color Pallette</p>
      <p>Show color palletes in combinations with contrast and text size and color parings, spell out the color contrast ratio. Show color combinations both good and bad people need to know what is bad</p>
      <p>Start building interfaces that can switch views so you have ability to show different views that may be better for more users</p>
      <p class="b">CSS calss names</p>
      <p>classes: current, expanded, error, hidden there are aria labels that are more descriptive and can provide more content. We have better ways to express these things, lets reproduce the meaning with an aria label or even in html</p>
      <p class="b"> High contrast tweaks</p>
      <p>Css images dissapear under high contrast theme so you need to take in account elements that dissapear in high contrast mode. The use of borders on things is a good idea since it can help on highcontrast theme, it can be really subbtle but can really help  </p>
      <p class="b"> Gestures</p>
      <p>Consider people that cant have gestures and add aditional methods to activate or interact with items </p>
      <p class="b"> Black holes</p>
      <p>set indication of items that rely only on visual ques. People want to know a context before going on that black hole and not knowing like in a carusel that has tons of items. What happens if you get down that path. Give users an out and stop using elements, is not all about getting access to items but a way out too. </p>
