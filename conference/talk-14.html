      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Navigation</p>
      <p>a link is a promise is a commitment, One of the rules of great navigation is not to break a promise. Make a commitment on the link and deliver</p>
      <p>Momentum. Navigation should move you forward. Help people move forward not try to go back or confuse the user. People know what they want. Help the user get there with the least confusion. </p>
      <p>We have to trust the user intent, and help them continue with their journey. You can still include a way back but should not be so prominent on the page.</p>
      <p>Unity is another principal for good navigation design. The more you add in different placecs you confuse people</p>
      <p>Icon are a horrible form of navigation, if you are going to use them in navigation put words to describe, icons can mean very different things to people Words are still the primary build block to navigation design. Icons that have labels have a 88% success rate for people to click or choose</p>
      <p>Hidden navigation is terrible, when visible navigation increases usage if you take a way the ability to take decisions people stop making decisions. Never hide the navigation</p>
      <p>There are exceptions when the hamburger menu can be a good strategy, that is when there is another super task which is the main purpose (like a google map) when you can begin your journey without the navigation. If you have an overwhelming task you can start with that purpose and hide the navigation</p>
      <p>Twins: ways on to how to look at a problem. OBJECT-SUBJECT You need to design for both journeys </p>
      <p>When a user reaches their desitination remove all the extra information so the user can focus on the task</p>
      <p>If your customers are looking at the navigation more the worse experience, the faster they use it to get to a point the better the navigation. Prioritze and give first what users need, so they move at faster pace and reduce frustration.</p>
      <p>Magnetism A great link says an action. If a group of links name has a counterpart like Quick links (slow links ? ) then the title is a bad group of links</p>

      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Method to design a better navigation</p>
      <p>Identify what matters the most to your users, and then group those tasks </p>
      <p>15 people for usability is  the best number for sample to get reliable patterns. Have these 15 people sort the tasks and put them in groups, but do not make them to name them. </p>
      <p>Based on data on the most used items determines what goes on the top. Use these as hypothesis and then test them.Tree testing you need to make at least 3 rounds to confirm and learn from the process. At the second round adjust the problems found in round one and confirm</p>
      <p>Design principles</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Momentum: Keeo people moving forward</li>
        <li>Unity : Make navigation as unified as possible</li>
        <li>Twins: Design for the jurneys customers are on</li>
        <li>Minimalism: have navigation take up as little space as is practical</li>
        <li>Clarity: Navigation must immediately communicate what it is and what it is not</li>
        <li>Fidelity: A link is a promise. Navigation should keep its promises </li>
        <li>Magnetism: Maximize clean magnetism. Minimize dirty magnetism</li>
      </ul>
