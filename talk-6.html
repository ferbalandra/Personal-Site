      <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Tech Humanism</p>
        <p>What are we as humans and how we relate to digital life and topics. UX designers bridge that gap where silly words that makes no sense to people like clicking a checkbox that you are human. The less you create meaning the more you create a vouid where absurdity can form.  </p>
        <p class="tc ttu b purple">Humans crave meaning</p>

        <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Integrated Human Experience Design</p>
        <p>Offline and online all context together, not just users customers patiens students etc. but awareness of people accross all their contexts, intentional layer of interactions and transactions with the adaptive execution of strategic intent </p>
        <p>Machine made driven experience is happening we need to be thinking of the ways that we can make sure that the human is represented. Machines are waht we encode of ourselves. We need to think what and how we encode these machine driven experiences, such as AI technology.</p>
        <p>The work of creating more meaningful experiences leads to more PROFIT</p>
        <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Strategic purpose leads to purposeful products</p>
        <p>For example in Disney their goal is to <span class="georgia i purple">Create Magical Experiences</span>so all staff from janitors to hosts when presented with a problem they resolved it whith the question what would create the most Magical Experiences? The new digital tools that they are implemented like a bracelet to can be used to pay, open doors and fast passes are aligned with Disney's pupose of <span class="georgia i purple">Creating Magical Experiences</span> </p>
        <p>Design experiences aligned with strategic purpose so that purpose can scale </p>
        <p>If we let our digital experiences take over our human interaction experiece at scale is culture and we are creating this new culture. We are literally shaping culture for the future. Meaning at scale by designing experiences that will scale wich amplify our humanity and not block humanism</p>
        <p class="silver b mb-neg" >Designing for Meaningful Automated Integrated Human Experiences </p>
        <p>Elements of Integrated Human Experience Design</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Integration</li>
          <li>Dimensionality (devices brand dimension in several tech) thinking of all the dimensions of human experience</li>
          <li>Metaphors and Cognitive Associations (what we relate them to human experiences)</li>
          <li>Intentionality / Purpose</li>
          <li>Value and Emotional Load</li>
          <li>Aligmnet</li>
          <li>Adaptation and Iteration</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The design of experience online now regularly intersects with the design of experiences off-line. Think how data can help automate more targeted human experiences and better experiences that are relevant to the users. </p>
        <p>How can we use the data in a relevant way where we increase the satisfaction of the experience. Just about everywhere the physical world and the digital world converge, the connective layer is the data captured through human experience.</p>
        <p>Nature vs shape of experience. For example Nature is water and the shape of experience is the bottle we use. As the shape of our surroundings change,
        the shape of our experience changes, too. Human experieces evolve but the shapes change more readily than the nature</p>
        <p>Ask yourself human metaphores that can relate to your data and how you show it.  </p>

        <div class=" w-70 pa2 center">
          <img src="images/metaphor-humanux.png">
        </div>

        <p>Use human interaction pretending to be automated to gather patterns Start with if-then statements, but find the nuance beyond if-then statements. Meaningful experiences, intelligently automated, aligned with strategic purpose </p>
        <p>A future of human experiences that don’t foster absurdity, that preserve meaning for the humans on the other side of the transaction. A future of humanity where our work has built meaning that can scale</p>
